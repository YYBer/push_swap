# push_swap

This is an algorithm project of 42.


For any random non-repeating set of numbers, they need to be sorted from smallest to largest.

The alignment can only use the following rules:

sa (swap a) : Swap the top two numbers in A

sb (swap b) : Swap the top two numbers in B

ss : sa + sb

ra (rotate a) : Top number in A goes to bottom of A

rb (rotate b) : Top number in B goes to bottom of B

rr : ra + rb

rra (reverse rotate a) : Bottom number in A goes to top of A

rra (reverse rotate b) : Bottom number in B goes to top of B

rrr : rra + rrb

pa (push a) : Top number in B goes to top of A

pb (push b) : Top number in A goes to top of B

For 100 numbersï¼Œaverage 650 steps.

For 500 numbers, average 5300-5400 steps.
